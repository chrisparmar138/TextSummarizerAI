# ✂ TextSummarizerAI — Text Summarization Tool

TextSummarizerAI is a small practice project that I built to understand how text processing and summarization logic works. The idea behind this project was to create a simple tool that can take a long piece of text and convert it into a shorter and more readable summary.

While working on this project, my focus was mainly on improving my logic building, problem-solving skills, and working with string and text handling.

## ✨ What This Tool Does

- Takes long input text from the user
- Processes the content
- Generates a shorter summarized version
- Keeps the meaning as close as possible to the original text

This project helped me understand how text-based applications work in real scenarios.

## 🎯 What I Learned From This Project

- How to design a simple problem-focused application
- Thinking about how users interact with a tool
- Writing logical steps for processing input
- Structuring small real-world style features

Even though this is a small project, it helped me strengthen my fundamentals.
